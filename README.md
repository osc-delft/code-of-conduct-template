# A Code of Conduct Template
tl:dr; A template based on [Open Science Comunity Delft (OSCD's)](https://osc-delft.github.io) [Code of Conduct (CoC)](https://github.com/osc-delft/osc-delft.github.io/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for anyone who'd like to reuse it!

OSCD's CoC is based on the one common for all Open Science Communities within the International Network of Open Science Communities (INOSC): https://osf.io/6gsye/

We are in the (continuous) process of modifying the OSCD's CoC to suit our community's needs - we aim to keep this template up-to-date with our CoC, as much as possible.

## How to use this template?
1. Click the green "Use this template" button on the top right to start a new GitHub repo with this CoC ([more detailed instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template))
3. Pay special attention to the reporting and enforcement sections and change them to suit your community/event. A few questions that might help:
   - How can community members/participants report any unacceptable/prohibited behaviour? This could be through emails, or in-person (if an event, for example)
     - Can they report anonymously, and if yes, how?
   - Who will read and handle the reports? This could be the events' organisers, or a dedicated team, or someone else.
     - Being transparent about these people is important - this is such that reporting members/participants know who has access to the report.
   - What can happen to those reported?
   - What happens if the contact person for reports are the target of the compliant?
